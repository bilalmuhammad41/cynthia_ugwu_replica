# Portfolio Website Project

This repo contains the source code of a replica of [Cynthia Ugwu](https://cynthiaugwu.com/)'s incredible website. My goal for this project is to create as many animations and effect Cynthia as implemented in her website to enhance my front-end development skills with ReactJS, JS, Tailwind CSS and CSS.

## Key technologies:

- ReactJS: for building the UI and managing state
- Tailwind CSS: for rapid prototyping and responsive design
- Vite: for fast development and bundling

## Project Status:
Following components are completed along with responsiveness and interactive animations.
- The desktop and mobile Nav menu.
- Home Section.
- Projects Section.

## Planned features:
- To implement the signature hovering effect in the projects section.
- To create separate pages for each project containing its description and details.

This portfolio website is a work in progress, and I plan to actively develop it.
